Sensor locations were plotted on an OpenStreet map of the UK using a pair of longitudes and latitudes from the provided CSV. The program reads the dataset into a dataframe and plots the locations of the sensors on the map provided. It also reads the Openstreet UK Map PNG file. 

The Python libaries used include matplotlib (pyplot), numpy and pandas. These can be installed from requirements.txt using 
**pip install -r requirements.txt**. use this if the libraries are not installed on your PC

The output plot was then saved in a JPEG file as **Amediku_GROWSensorLocations_plot**.
